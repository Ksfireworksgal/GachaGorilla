# GachaGorilla
Lynette White - Final Project

I am very active in the virtual environment of Second Life.  It's an interactive world of possiblities that has been around since 2002.  Created by Linden Labs - the environment exceeded expectiations as the users litterally created everything with in the world of SL.  

Many found builing and creating fashions as an way to expand their SL.  From this has sprung many avenues for deisgners to create and users to purchase and enjoy.  About four hears ago a fade started.  Similar to those machines you see at the exit to stores, where you put a quater in and get part of collection.  Gacha's started in Second Life.  A couple of events was all it took and the wild fire fade became a sought after market.  

The market is multilayered.  First you have the Designer who makes the most.  The create a set of 4 - ?? pieces and put them in a machine.They set a price which is called the pull price any where from 5 lindens to 150 lindends. The costumer plays the machine to try and get the set especially those RARE items which you have less chance of getting.  Most machines are set to 9-15% chance of getting a RARE.

Now the player has 12 (or some number of them) commons that are duplicates.  Because the items are transferable - they can resell or trade the item for those they need or want.  

Here is the third layer of the Gacha Pie.  How to get rid of those duplicates, maybe make some of your money back.  Or sell that exclusive RARE.  There is a working Blinko machine from the 1st Arcade.  This machine has been retired (meaning the designer will never put the machine out again for play).  This machine is considred the RAREIST of Rares - asking price is $L15,000 roughly $300.00.

So here is where my project comes in.  With all these Gachas, we need a way to track them for resale and trade.  That is how Gacha Gorilla was dreamed up.  My goal is to contintue this project and morph it into a functioning web based db so that the consumer can get track of their items.  And allow those seeking items to find them without having to search store to store.
